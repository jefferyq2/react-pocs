**Synopsis**

This sample app is taken from an article hosted in RayWanderlich (https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial) and modified to use more ES 6's features. In this sample, we will see usage examples of NavigatorIOS, calling REST API using HTML5's Fetch class, ListView, event, state and few more.

**TODO's Things to improve this sample**
- Modularise the project's structure.
- Run the sample on Android as well
- Improve responsive looks when the device's orientation is changed to Landscape position
